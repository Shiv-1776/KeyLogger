# Advanced Keylogger – For Educational and Ethical Use:
This project is a Python-based keylogging tool built strictly for learning and ethical research purposes. It offers insight into how keystroke logging works at a low level, how captured data can be securely handled, and how such tools should be responsibly developed and studied in the context of cybersecurity awareness.

# Key Highlights:
• Live keystroke capture with precise timestamps
• AES-encrypted logging to protect captured data from unauthorized access
• Decryption utility to safely review logged keystrokes
• Modular and well-organized structure – separates logic, utilities, and logs
• Safe exit mechanism using the Esc key
• Expandable design – potential for future features like:
• Email-based log reports
• Remote log synchronization
• GUI for monitoring and control

# Security-Centric Design:
• Unlike malicious tools, this keylogger emphasizes responsible use and security practices:
• Uses AES encryption with a customizable key to secure logs
• Provides a secure log viewer to avoid manual exposure of sensitive data
• Ideal for security students, educators, and ethical hackers to explore keylogging in a controlled environment

# Disclaimer
This tool is created solely for educational demonstrations and ethical testing. Do not use it on any system or network without proper authorization. Unauthorized use may be illegal and unethical.
